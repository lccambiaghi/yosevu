# Who am I

My name is Luca, I am a Computer Scientist.
I grew up in northern Italy, orbiting around Milan.
In 2016 I moved to Copenhagen to achieve my MSc in Computer Science.

My favourite hobby is travelling.
After my graduation I spent 3 months backpacking across Chile, Bolivia, Peru and Colombia.
Another beautiful backpacking trip I have done was when visiting Nepal and India.

I also love reading and watching good movies and TV show.
The last book I read was &ldquo;12 rules for life&rdquo; by Jordan Peterson.
The last TV show I (re)watched was Breaking Bad.

# How I do it

I am most productive with Python.
On a day to day basis I work with `numpy`, `pandas` and `scikit-learn`.

During my first year as a FTE I added Docker and Kubernetes to my toolbox.

I am fascinated by `clojure` and functional programming.
My free time projects are often an attempt to learn some part of the ecosystem.
I look forward to the day I will be doing my data science work in `clojure`.
